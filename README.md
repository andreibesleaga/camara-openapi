# camara-openapi
[Unofficial] The Linux Foundation Projects - CAMARA [Telco Global API Alliance] - Unified OpenAPI

This repository aggregates all CAMARA OpenAPI specs into a single file, trying by script and github actions to get remote individual OpenAPI specs for all the stable APIs: https://camaraproject.org/api-overview/

The merged OpenAPI spec is available in `dist/camara-openapi.yaml` and is automatically regenerated when any of the individual specs change.
